Short Bio
===================================================

This is a brief summary of my journey so far as a researcher/developer:

- circa 1983. Discovered computers at age 5-7. Started reading every manual or magazine I could get my hands on about BASIC, assembler, games, ... I had frequent access to a couple of MSX micro-computers I would practice the little nuggets of knowledge I could gather.

- circa 1988. After insisting for years, I miraculously got my own first computer. A Philips NMS 9100 (Intel 8088).

- My life was taken over by GW-BASIC and x86 assembly. Then I jumped over to Pascal, and then C and C++, which is still my language of choice.

- 1995. Studied Computer Engineering (a 6-year degree back then). Meanwhile I worked as a programmer in the medical visualization field so I could afford my tuition. Every spare minute was otherwise spent on a myriad of personal coding projects; often custom game engines and computer graphics stuff.

- 2001. Started my PHD in applied math.

- 2001. I co-founded Feversoft SL (my first company). We were doing consulting in architectural visualization using our own software tech, and (at least back then) bleeding edge tech such as VR HMDs, stereoscopic displays, tactile surfaces, ...

- 2004. I created fryrender, which became one of the very first physically-based render engines.

- 2006. First public release of fryrender.

- 2008. Feversoft got split. I founded RandomControl SLU.

- 2011. Arion (GPU-accelerated) was released, superseding fryrender (CPU-only). It was one of the very first GPU-accelerated render engines.

- 2014. ArionFX was released.

- 2017. Development of Maverick Render started.

- 2019. First public releases of Maverick Studio and Maverick Indie.

- 2023. Maverick Excelsior was released.
