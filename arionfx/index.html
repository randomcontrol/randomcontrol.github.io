_RandomControl is a software company founded in 2008 specialized in GPU-accelerated
simulation of the physics of light for product rendering and image post-processing._

What is ArionFX?
===================================================

**ArionFX** is a versatile tool that offers a variety of key HDR image processing algorithms designed to function in floating-point 32-bit HDR data.

Remarkably, ArionFX operates in Linear Workflow, not washing out your image, and respecting its full dynamic range at all times.

Features
===================================================

_We can proudly say that we have been at the forefront of physically-based rendering
and GPU-acceleration for nearly two decades._

This is a chronology of our main releases over the years:

* ![ ](/images/randomcontrol-history-maverick-indie.webp width="192")_Late 2019_. **Maverick Indie** is an excellent rendering solution to import models and materials from Substance Painter/Designer, Zbrush, or Sketchfab and take amazing photo-real shots or render turntable presentations with the best quality and the least effort.
<br />

* ![ ](/images/randomcontrol-history-maverick-studio.webp width="192")_Mid-2019_. **Maverick Studio** is a GPU-accelerated render engine where our proprietary light simulation core is harnessed behind intuitive drag-and-drop tools. In Maverick you can import 3D models or CAD data and render impressive photo-real images with minimal effort.
<br />

* ![ ](/images/randomcontrol-history-double-down.webp width="192")_Early 2018_. **Double-down**. We were blessed by some business opportunities in 2017 that eventually led to the arrival of private investment. The goal was to double-down on our main areas of expertise: physically-based light simulation, image post-processing, and GPU-acceleration.
<br />

* ![ ](/images/randomcontrol-history-arionfx.webp width="192")_2014_. **ArionFX** is a set of tools for Lens Effects and HDR image post-processing that spawns from the tonemapping toolchain in Arion. ArionFX is distributed as a plug-in for all versions of Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. Some of the most remarkable features of ArionFX are physically-based Bloom & Glare, and advanced local/global Tone-Compression operators.
<br />

* ![ ](/images/randomcontrol-history-arion.webp width="192")_2011_. **Arion**. The success of fryrender led to the birth of Arion, which started as a port/rewrite of the fryrender core in Nvidia CUDA. Arion was one of the first GPU-accelerated render engines in the market. Over the years, most of the 3D industry has followed the same path.
<br />

* ![ ](/images/randomcontrol-history-fryrender.webp width="192")_2006_. **Fryrender** was a pioneering product in the field of unbiased simulation of the physics of light. This approach to image synthesis, which meant a radical departure from classic rendering at the moment, has been widely embraced by the industry since then.
